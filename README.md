# Career Coach

The "Career Coach" app utilizes the power of GPT-3 to help individuals advance their careers. It is an innovative tool that provides personalized job suggestions and career development resources to users based on their current experience and desired job preferences. In order to use GPT-3, the developer must have an OpenAI account, access to the text-davinci-003 model, and knowledge of finetuning the model to suit the specific needs of the app.

To start programming this application, a student must have knowledge of programming languages such as Python, Pytorch and JavaScript. Furthermore, experience with machine learning and a good understanding of CUDA and Nvidia Container is essential as GPT-3 runs on these platforms. The student should also have experience with scraping data from LinkedIn and integrating it with the app. To make the most of GPT-3 capabilities and to ensure high performance, renting a GPU machine on vast.ai is recommended.

The following code is an example of how to use the OpenAI API to fine-tune the text-davinci-003 model for use in the "Career Coach" app:

```Python

import openai_secret_manager

# Get API key
secrets = openai_secret_manager.get_secret("openai")
api_key = secrets["api_key"]

# Fine-tune the text-davinci-003 model
model_engine = "text-davinci-002"
prompt = (f"Fine-tune the {model_engine} model for job recommendation "
          f"based on user's current experience and desired job preferences")

completions = openai.Completion.create(
    engine=model_engine,
    prompt=prompt,
    max_tokens=1024,
    n=1,
    stop=None,
    temperature=0.7,
    api_key=api_key
)

message = completions.choices[0].text
print(message)
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
