# Career Coach

The "Career Coach" app utilizes the power of GPT-3 to help individuals advance their careers. It is an innovative tool that provides personalized job suggestions and career development resources to users based on their current experience and desired job preferences. In order to use GPT-3, the developer must have an OpenAI account, access to the text-davinci-003 model, and knowledge of finetuning the model to suit the specific needs of the app.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
